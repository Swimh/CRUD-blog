# CRUD-blog

Basic blog application, with Laravel, where I focused on the main four basic operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
The design, Html and Css I have integrated in the blade from the Jeffrey's Way HTML and CSS workshop: https://laracasts.com/series/html-and-css-workshop.
And from here and there I have put my hands in the code and come across Tailwind, which was really nice. 
Besides the CRUD operations I have implemented a search and a pagination. 

This was a nice way to discover how much simpler Laravel can make your life. I have much more to work on it, and I can't wait!
